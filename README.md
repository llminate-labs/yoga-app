# Yoga App

This is a project for a Yoga App.

## Testing Instructions:
1. **Unit Testing:** 
   - Write unit tests to cover the following scenarios:
      - Adding a new yoga pose to the collection.
      - Updating an existing yoga pose.
      - Deleting a yoga pose from the collection.
      - Retrieving all yoga poses from the collection.

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test the integration of the backend system with the database:
      - Verify that the yoga poses are stored correctly in the database.
      - Test CRUD operations on the yoga poses collection in the database.

3. **API Testing:**
   - Test the API endpoints for managing yoga poses:
      - Test adding a new yoga pose through the API.
      - Test updating a yoga pose through the API.
      - Test deleting a yoga pose through the API.
      - Test retrieving all yoga poses through the API.

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - Test the performance of the backend system when handling a large number of yoga poses.
   - Measure response times for CRUD operations on the yoga poses collection.

5. **Security Testing:**
   - Perform security testing to ensure that the API endpoints are secure and protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
   - Ensure that sensitive data is handled securely.
