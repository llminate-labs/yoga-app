## Instructions for Automated Tests Validation

### Running Automated Tests:

1. **Header rules - yogagpt Test:**
   - Navigate to the project directory where the automated tests are stored.
   - Locate the test suite or script designated for `Header rules - yogagpt`.
   - Execute the test suite or script by running the following command:
     ```
     run_test_suite header_rules_yogagpt
     ```

2. **Pages changed - yogagpt Test:**
   - Within the same project directory, identify the test suite or script mapped to `Pages changed - yogagpt`.
   - Run the test suite or script using the command:
     ```
     run_test_suite pages_changed_yogagpt
     ```

3. Monitor the test execution to ensure all test scenarios are evaluated comprehensively.
4. Review the test results for each test case to validate the expected outcomes.
5. Check the test logs for any abnormalities, failures, or errors encountered during the test runs.

Once the automated tests for `Header rules - yogagpt` and `Pages changed - yogagpt` have finished executing, gather the test results and logs to assess the test coverage and outcomes accurately. Feel free to share the results for further examination and decision-making. If you face any challenges or need assistance, don't hesitate to ask for help.
